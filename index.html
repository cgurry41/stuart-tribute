    <h1>Making the Kinfolk Proud: A Stuart Scott Story</h1>

<p>Most of the time, I hardly registered the anchors’ voices - just noise blending into the chaos. But this day, something stopped me mid-step as the SC Top 10 Plays flashed on the screen for the second time.</p>
<p>SportsCenter was the soundtrack to my childhood weekends growing up in the shadow of ESPN headquarters in Connecticut. From 9 a.m. to noon Eastern, it blared in the background as my brother and I shuffled around the house – scrambling for sneakers and jerseys, tripping over the dog.</p><p>“...coming in at number 5, Dwayne must have called Stephanie Gurry, ’cause the bank is open on a Sunday!”</p><p><em>Ain’t no way...</em></p><p>I halted in the doorway, half-dressed and ready to bolt for the car. My head snapped toward the screen just in time to see Dwayne Wade nailing a turnaround bank shot from the short corner. D-Wade is known the world over by any self-respecting basketball fan, but I was in one of the few households with 100% name recognition of Stephanie Gurry, the Avon, CT banker.</p><p>I turned to my mom, who was still in the kitchen. “Did Stuart just mention you on SportsCenter?”</p><p>She chuckled as she looked over from the sink. “Ya, baby. I think he did. Such a goofball.”</p><p>For the first time in my intransigent teenage existence, the thought crossed my mind: <em>My mom is cool.</em></p><p>Of course, Stuart Scott could do that.</p>

<div class="divider"></div><p>Much has been written about Stuart Scott - the trailblazing ESPN anchor, pop culture icon, and the fighter who refused to let an eight-year cancer battle stop him from living to the fullest. But my small window into the Stuart Scott experience shows a man who believed his success and recognition were a privilege to be shared by the people in his corner.</p>

<p>Stuart and my mom had a seemingly unlikely friendship. A prominent African American TV personality from Chicago by way of Winston-Salem, North Carolina. A White bank manager and military brat who bounced around from Nebraska to Alabama, California, Iowa and Connecticut to name a few. One, a hip-hop fan who quotes Nas and Jay-Z on broadcasts. The other, a country girl who’s seen George Strait in three different cities. Demographic and professional characteristics would place Stuart a lot closer to Steph Curry than to Steph Gurry.</p><p>Biographies aside though, the foundation of their friendship, from the late 90’s to his passing in 2015, was simple. Shared geography, a smack-talking sports fanaticism, and above all, self-identification as a parent first and an anything-else second.</p>

<p>The friendship didn’t manifest in family outings or play dates (Though I do recall ducking behind office partitions in a near-empty bank trying to hide from my enemy commando – Stuart). It was in occasional meetings at the bank when Scott was in town, needling texts when the other person’s college team took a tough L, and the steady stream of braggadocious messages that chronicled the small triumphs of their favorite topics: their kids. We got updates on Taelor and Sydni’s dance competitions, art showcases, and honor roll achievements. Stuart got the admittedly purified version of my brother, Kevin’s, impressive ERA as a freshman pitcher, my snub from the All-Conference basketball team as a senior, and our college searches.</p>

<p>It must have been some combination of this inflated image of my talent and gratitude for those who paved the way for him. But when he heard I intended to try to walk-on to the basketball team at Georgia Tech, he phoned up second-year Tech Head Coach, Brian Gregory.</p> 

<p>I have to imagine Coach Gregory, in the early stages of trying to restore a struggling team to its former glory, had bigger fish to fry than “a talented young player from small-town Connecticut and a really good kid.” Still, any media-savvy major Division 1 coach knows not to turn down a call from one of the most influential sports journalists on TV. He told Stuart I could try out and I would get a fair shot.</p>

<p>Weeks later, when I approached Assistant Coach Postorino’s office, I was pushing on an open door. I didn’t have to sell myself; I wasn’t an unknown potential waste of time. He gave me the time and place of the tryout and told me to come ready to play. The rest was up to me.</p>


<div class="divider"></div><p>An introvert at heart, the life of a walk-on basketball player suited me. Early morning workouts, class, practice, homework, then back to the gym to get up shots. I didn’t have the skills or talent to genuinely compete with these future pros, but it didn’t matter. I got to stay in the gym, try to challenge them in practice, and learn from coaches with decades of experience.</p><p>On gamedays, my teammates suited up against basketball royalty like Duke and North Carolina. My role was more understated. Execute the opposing team’s plays during walk-through, dole out high fives, and keep the energy up on the bench.</p><p>Even so, I lived and died with the wins and losses of my rollercoaster freshman season of ACC basketball.</p>

<p>On a weeknight away game in March, I looked up at the scoreboard after Coach called our final timeout. 69-69 with 28 seconds to go. Largely on the back of freshman, Chris Bolden, we had just erased a 13-point deficit against 6th-ranked UMiami. Late in a season marked by hard fought close losses, we needed a reason to be optimistic heading into the post season tournaments.</p><p>That night in Coral Gables, Florida, Marcus Georges-Hunt became the reason.</p>

<p>Following his own missed floater, he tipped in the game-winning field goal with his left hand as time expired. I leapt onto the court to join the scrum of teammates suffocating our late game hero. It’s hard to describe the combination of elation, relief and camaraderie after a gritty road win, but it follows you into the locker room and onto the team bus.</p><p>An hour later, the adrenaline slowly wore off as I took my seat at the back of the coach bus carrying us to Miami International Airport. My thoughts drifted back to Atlanta, where a Thermodynamics make-up quiz and Calc II assignment awaited my return. That’s why I barely heard the ESPN highlights piping through the bus speaker system recounting our massive upset.</p><p>“… Chris Bolden hits the corner 3. All those practice reps with Colin Gurry must be paying off ‘cause that man was lights out tonight…”</p><p><em>Ain’t no way.</em> My focus returned to the moment and I now recognized the distinctive voice anchoring the 11p.m. SportsCenter broadcast. Stuart Scott.</p><p>The bus went silent, and heads turned toward my seat in the back. Coach Gregory shot me a knowing smirk.</p><p>“Bro, respectfully, I had 21 tonight and you rode the bench. How in the hell are you getting the SportsCenter shoutout?” said Chris.</p><p>“No sweat, Chris,” I said. “If you need some extra work on your jumper, just let me know after practice tomorrow.”</p><p>Satisfied with a witty comeback, I eased back in my chair. For the first time in my college athletic career, the thought crossed my mind: <em>Steph Gurry’s son might be cool too.</em></p><div class="divider"></div><p>Ten years after his passing, Stuart still looms large. His legacy lives in Taelor and Sydni, his Memorial Cancer Research Fund, and a slight bend in the arch of sports journalism toward authenticity and joy. Of course, the ripple effects of his generous spirit also travel far.</p><p>Stephanie Gurry and I can attest: If you had the privilege of crossing paths with Stuart Scott, you might know what it’s like to be cooler than the other side of the pillow.</p>
